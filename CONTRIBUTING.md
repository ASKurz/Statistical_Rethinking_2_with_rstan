This repository is the GitHub home for my **rstan**/**tidyverse** translation of McElreath's [*Statistical rethinking: Second edition*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).

This project is something of a living document and I welcome corrections, suggestions, and solutions to any of the problems I have yet to fully work out. 

## Code of conduct

I don't care if you come off as professional or not, but please try to be kind.

## *I just have a question*.

I do not have a high enough question volume to need a formal question policy, at this time. I have fielded them in personal emails, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz) (either out in the open or sliding in my DMs), on the [Stan Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/), or as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_2_with_rstan/issues). In general, I prefer it when asked questions in an open format, so that others can (a) chime in and (b) benefit from the discussion. Other approaches are fine. However, I reserve the right to respond at my own pace.

## *I would like to contribute*.

Great! I'm guessing most contributions will fall under:

* reporting typos, code breaks, and hyperlink breaks,
* reporting errors in the code,
* responding to requests for help in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_2_with_rstan/issues), or
* requesting features.

I generally prefer people use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_2_with_rstan/issues) for these. However, it's okay if you would like to make a pull request. Beware that PR's tend to make me nervous and I'm more likely to avoid them in favor of responding to the issues. Sometimes it makes sense to correspond with me by email, but I ask you use that as a last option.

## Code style

I generally follow the recommendations in [*The tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/), so if you plan on recommending a big chunk of code, **tidyverse** conventions are generally preferred.

## Credit

I make it a practice to thank my contributors in the `index.Rmd` files of all my ebooks. If your contribution ends up in the ebook, I'll happily add your name and GitHub handle to the list. If for some reason you don't want to be added to the list, please let me know and I'll respect your privacy. 

Every once in a while, someone helps with a substantial contribution. In those cases, I like to give shout outs right in the body of the text. Just like my stance for smaller contributions, I'm happy to leave your name out of the text if you prefer your privacy.
