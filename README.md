# *Statistical rethinking 2* with rstan and the tidyverse 

Welcome to the sister project of my [*Statistical rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/). Our aim is to translate the code from McElreath's [second edition](http://elevanth.org/blog/2018/07/14/statistical-rethinking-edition-2-eta-2020/) to fit within an [**rstan**](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/) and [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) framework. The current 0.0.1 version contains drafts for the first 8 chapters, which have been stitched together into an ebook with quarto.
